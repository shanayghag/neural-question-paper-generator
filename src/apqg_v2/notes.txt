Things to do:
    1. Marks distribution algorithm
        - Approach 1: Linear regression to find the best combination of quantities of blooms level as per difficulty and no. of questions.
            - y = c1*x1 + c2*x2 + c3*x3
              and
              (c1new - c1old)^2 + (c2new - c2old)^2 + (c3new - c3old)^2 is minimum
              where x: marks, c: quantity, y: tot_marks
              
              In linear regression, we estimate the value of the coefficients



    2. Handle: No. of questions > Pool of questions (for one or more blooms levels)
    3. Beam search for variety
        - Generate multiple question paper sets
    4. Handle duplicates
    5. Add warnings to frontend
    6. Input: DeepPDF / User selects relevant parts of the text after uploading
    7. Output: Document file
